This diagram illustrates the workflow in sentiment analysis using the IndoBERT model.
- Data Crawling - Data is collected and stored in the form of datasets.
- Pre-processing & Labeling - Data is processed with techniques such as text cleaning, case folding, text normalisation, tokenisation, stopwords removal, and utilisation of InSet Lexicon to provide sentiment labels.
- Model Train & Test - IndoBERT model is utilised and fine-tuned to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.
- Model Evaluation - Model results were evaluated using Confusion Matrix to measure classification performance.
- Implementation & Results - Analysis results are visualised to further understand model performance.


# Dataset
Data that has been crawled previously is preprocessed so that it is ready to be processed in the algorithm used, there are 6 stages of data preprocessing used in this research.
